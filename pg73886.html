<h1>
SCANNERS LIVE IN VAIN
</h1>
<p><br></p>
<p class="t2b">
BY CORDWAINER SMITH
</p>
<p class="intro">
This story deals with science-fiction's oldest
subject—space-travel.
Yet the author's treatment of the subject is so
completely different that it makes "SCANNERS" one of the most
outstanding stories to appear in any magazine!
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
Martel was angry.  He did not even adjust his blood
away from anger.  He stamped across the room by judgment,
not by sight.  When he saw the table hit the floor,
and could tell by the expression on Luci's face that the
table must have made a loud crash, he looked down to see
if his leg were broken.  It was not.  Scanner to the core,
he had to scan himself.  The action was reflex and
automatic.  The inventory included his legs, abdomen,
Chestbox of instruments, hands, arms, face and back with the
Mirror.  Only then did Martel go back to being angry.
He talked with his voice, even though he knew that his
wife hated its blare and preferred to have him write.
</p>
<p>
"I tell you, I must cranch.  I have to cranch.  It's my
worry, isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
When Luci answered, he saw only a part of her words
as he read her lips: "Darling ... you're my
husband ... right to love you ... dangerous ... do
it ... dangerous ... wait ...."
</p>
<p>
He faced her, but put sound in his voice, letting the
blare hurt her again: "I tell you, I'm going to cranch."
</p>
<p>
Catching her expression, he became rueful and a little
tender: "Can't you understand what it means to me?  To
get out of this horrible prison in my own head?  To be
<i>feel</i> again—to feel my feet on the ground, to feel the air
a man again—hearing your voice, smelling smoke?  To
move against my face?  Don't you know what it means?"
</p>
<p>
Her wide-eyed worrisome concern thrust him back
into pure annoyance.  He read only a few words as her
lips moved: "... love you ... your own good ... don't you
think I want you to be human? ... your own good ... too
much ... he said ... they said ...."
</p>
<p>
When he roared at her, he realized that his voice must
be particularly bad.  He knew that the sound hurt her
no less than did the words: "Do you think I wanted you
to marry a Scanner?  Didn't I tell you we're almost as
low as the habermans?  We're dead, I tell you.  We've
got to be dead to do our work.  How can anybody go to
the Up-and-Out?  Can you dream what raw Space is?  I
warned you.  But you married me.  All right, you
married a man.  Please, darling, let me be a man.  Let me
hear your voice, let me feel the warmth of being alive, of
being human.  Let me!"
</p>
<p>
He saw by her look of stricken assent that he had won
the argument.  He did not use his voice again.  Instead,
he pulled his tablet up from where it hung against his
chest.  He wrote on it, using the pointed fingernail of his
right forefinger—the Talking Nail of a Scanner—in quick
cleancut script: "Pls, drlng, whrs Crnching Wire?"
</p>
<p>
She pulled the long gold-sheathed wire out of the pocket
of her apron.  She let its field sphere fall to the carpeted
floor.  Swiftly, dutifully, with the deft obedience of a
Scanner's wife, she wound the Cranching Wire around
his head, spirally around his neck and chest.  She avoided
the instruments set in his chest.  She even avoided the
radiating scars around the instruments, the stigmata of
men who had gone Up and into the Out.  Mechanically
he lifted a foot as she slipped the wire between his feet.
She drew the wire taut.  She snapped the small plug into
the High Burden Control next to his Heart Reader.  She
helped him to sit down, arranging his hands for him,
pushing his head back into the cup at the top of the chair.
She turned then, full-face toward him, so that he could
read her lips easily.  Her expression was composed.
</p>
<p>
She knelt, scooped up the sphere at the other end of the
wire, stood erect calmly, her back to him.  He scanned
her, and saw nothing in her posture but grief which would
have escaped the eye of anyone but a Scanner.  She spoke:
he could see her chest-muscles moving.  She realized
that she was not facing him, and turned so that he could
see her lips.
</p>
<p>
"Ready at last?"
</p>
<p>
He smiled a <i>yes</i>.
</p>
<p>
She turned her back to him again.  (Luci could never
bear to watch him Under-the-wire.)  She tossed the wiresphere
into the air.  It caught in the force-field, and hung
there.  Suddenly it glowed.  That was all.  All—except
for the sudden red stinking roar of coming back to his
senses.  Coming back, across the wild threshold of pain.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
</h3>
<p>
When he awakened under the wire, he did not feel as
though he had just cranched.  Even though it was the
second cranching within the week, he felt fit.  He lay in
the chair.  His ears drank in the sound of air touching
things in the room.  He heard Luci breathing in the next
room, where she was hanging up the wire to cool.  He
smelt the thousand-and-one smells that are in anybody's
room: the crisp freshness of the germ-burner, the
sour-sweet tang of the humidifier, the odor of the dinner they
had just eaten, the smells of clothes, furniture, of people
themselves.  All these were pure delight.  He sang a
phrase or two of his favorite song:
</p>
<p class="poem">
  "Here's to the haberman, Up and Out!<br>
      "Up—oh!—and Out—oh!—Up and Out!..."<br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
He heard Luci chuckle in the next room.  He gloated
over the sounds of her dress as she swished to the
doorway.
</p>
<p>
She gave him her crooked little smile.  "You sound
all right.  Are you all right, really?"
</p>
<p>
Even with this luxury of senses, he scanned.  He took
the flash-quick inventory which constituted his
professional skill.  His eyes swept in the news of the
instruments.  Nothing showed off scale, beyond the Nerve
Compression hanging in the edge of "Danger."  But he
could not worry about the Nerve box.  That always came
through Cranching.  You couldn't get under the wire
without having it show on the Nerve box.  Some day the
box would go to <i>Overload</i> and drop back down to <i>Dead</i>.
That was the way a haberman ended.  But you couldn't
have everything.  People who went to the Up-and-Out
had to pay the price for Space.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, he should worry!  He was a Scanner.  A
good one, and he knew it.  If he couldn't scan himself,
who could?  This cranching wasn't too dangerous.
Dangerous, but not too dangerous.
</p>
<p>
Luci put out her hand and ruffled his hair as if she had
been reading his thoughts, instead of just following them:
"But you know you shouldn't have!  You shouldn't!"
</p>
<p>
"But I did!"  He grinned at her.
</p>
<p>
Her gaiety still forced, she said: "Come on, darling,
let's have a good time.  I have almost everything there
is in the icebox—all your favorite tastes.  And I have
two new records just full of smells.  I tried them out
myself, and even I liked them.  And you know me—"
</p>
<p>
"Which?"
</p>
<p>
"Which what, you old darling?"
</p>
<p>
He slipped his hand over her shoulders as he limped
out of the room.  (He could never go back to feeling the
floor beneath his feet, feeling the air against his face,
without being bewildered and clumsy.  As if cranching
was real, and being a haberman was a bad dream.  But
he was a haberman, and a Scanner.)  "You know what
I meant, Luci....  the smells, which you have.  Which one
did you like, on the record?"
</p>
<p>
"Well-l-l," said she, judiciously, "there were some lamb
chops that were the strangest things—"
</p>
<p>
He interrupted: "What are lambtchots?"
</p>
<p>
"Wait till you smell them.  Then guess.  I'll tell you
this much.  It's a smell hundreds and hundreds of years
old.  They found about it in the old books."
</p>
<p>
"Is a lambtchot a Beast?"
</p>
<p>
"I won't tell you.  You've got to wait," she laughed, as
she helped him sit down and spread his tasting dishes
before him.  He wanted to go back over the dinner first,
sampling all the pretty things he had eaten, and savoring
them this time with his now-living lips and tongue.
</p>
<p>
When Luci had found the Music Wire and had thrown
its sphere up into the force-field, he reminded her of the
new smells.  She took out the long glass records and set
the first one into a transmitter.
</p>
<p>
"Now sniff!"
</p>
<p>
A queer frightening, exciting smell came over the room.
It seemed like nothing-in this world, nor like anything
from the Up-and-Out.  Yet it was familiar.  His mouth
watered.  His pulse beat a little faster; he scanned his
Heart box.  (Faster, sure enough.)  But that smell,
what was it?  In mock perplexity, he grabbed her hands,
looked into her eyes, and growled:
</p>
<p>
"Tell me, darling!  Tell me, Or I'll eat you up!"
</p>
<p>
"That's just right!"
</p>
<p>
"What?"
</p>
<p>
"You're right.  It should make you want to eat me.  It's
meat."
</p>
<p>
"Meat.  Who?"
</p>
<p>
"Not a person," said she, knowledgeably, "a beast.  A
beast which people used to eat.  A lamb was a small
sheep—you've seen sheep out in the Wild, haven't you?—and
a chop is part of its middle—here!"  She pointed at
her chest.
</p>
<p>
Martel did not hear her.  All his boxes had swung
over toward Alarm, some to Danger.  He fought against
the roar of his own mind, forcing his body into excess
excitement.  How easy it was to be a Scanner when you
really stood outside your own body, haberman-fashion,
and looked back into it with your eyes alone.  Then you
could manage the body, rule it coldy even in the enduring
agony of Space.  But to realize that you <i>were</i> a body, that
this thing was ruling you, that the mind could kick the
flesh and send it roaring off into panic!  That was bad.
</p>
<p>
He tried to remember the days before he had gone into
the Haberman Device, before he had been cut apart for
the Up-and-Out.  Had he always been subject to the rush
of his emotions from his mind to his body, from his body
back to his mind, confounding him so that he couldn't
Scan?  But he hadn't been a Scanner then.
</p>
<p>
He knew what had hit him.  Amid the roar of his own
pulse, he knew.  In the nightmare of the Up-and-Out,
that smell had forced its way through to him, while their
ship burned off Venus and the habermans fought the
collapsing metal with their bare hands.  He had scanned
then: all were in Danger.  Chestboxes went up to
<i>Overload</i> and dropped to <i>Dead</i> all around him as he had moved
from man to man, shoving the drifting corpses out of his
way as he fought to scan each man in turn, to clamp vises
on unnoticed broken legs, to snap the Sleeping Valve on
men whose instruments showed they were hopelessly near
overload.  With men trying to work and cursing him for
a Scanner while he, professional zeal aroused, fought to
do his job and keep them alive in the Great Pain of Space,
he had smelled that smell.  It had fought its way along
his rebuilt nerves, past the Haberman cuts, past all the
safeguards of physical and mental discipline.  In the
wildest hour of tragedy, he had smelled aloud.  He
remembered it was like a bad cranching, connected with the
fury and nightmare all around him.  He had even stopped
his work to scan himself, fearful that the First Effect
might come, breaking past all Haberman cuts and ruining
him with the Pain of Space.  But he had come through.
His own instruments stayed and stayed at <i>Danger</i>,
without nearing <i>Overload</i>.  He had done his job, and won a
commendation for it.  He had even forgotten the burning
ship.
</p>
<p>
All except the smell.
</p>
<p>
And here the smell was all over again—the smell of
meat-with-fire....
</p>
<p>
Luci looked at him with wifely concern.  She obviously
thought he had cranched too much, and was about to
haberman back.  She tried to be cheerful: "You'd better
rest, honey."
</p>
<p>
He whispered to her: "Cut—off—that—smell."
</p>
<p>
She did not question his word.  She cut the transmitter.
She even crossed the room and stepped up the room controls
until a small breeze flitted across the floor and drove
the smells up to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
He rose, tired and stiff.  (His instruments were normal,
except that Heart was fast and Nerves still hanging
on the edge of <i>Danger</i>.)  He spoke sadly:
</p>
<p>
"Forgive me, Luci.  I suppose I shouldn't have
cranched.  Not so soon again.  But darling, I have to
get out from being a haberman.  How can I ever be near
you?  How can I be a man—not hearing my own voice,
not even feeling my own life as it goes through my veins?
I love you, darling.  Can't I ever be near you?"
</p>
<p>
Her pride was disciplined and automatic: "But you're
a Scanner!"
</p>
<p>
"I know I'm a Scanner.  But so what?"
</p>
<p>
She went over the words, like a tale told a thousand
times to reassure herself: "You are the bravest of the
brave, the most skilful of the skilled.  All Mankind owes
most honor to the Scanner, who unites the Earths of
Mankind.  Scanners are the protectors of the Habermans.
They are the judges in the Up-and Out.  They make men
live in the place where men need desperately to die.  They
are the most honored of Mankind, and even the Chiefs of
the Instrumentality are delighted to pay them homage!"
</p>
<p>
With obstinate sorrow he demurred: "Luci, we've
heard that all before.  But does it pay us back—"
</p>
<p>
"'Scanners work for more than pay.  They are the
strong guards of Mankind.'  Don't you remember that?"
</p>
<p>
"But our lives, Luci.  What can you get out of being
the wife of a Scanner?  Why did you marry me?  I'm
human only when I cranch.  The rest of the time—you
know what I am.  A machine.  A man turned into a
machine.  A man who has been killed and kept alive for
duty.  Don't you realize what I miss?"
</p>
<p>
"Of course, darling, of course—"
</p>
<p>
He went on: "Don't you think I remember my childhood?
Don't you think I remember what it is to be a
man and not a haberman?  To walk and feel my feet on
the ground?  To feel a decent clean pain instead of
watching my body every minute to see if I'm alive?  How will I
know if I'm dead?  Did you ever think of that, Luci?
How will I know if I'm dead?"
</p>
<p>
She ignored the unreasonableness of his outburst.
Pacifyingly, she said: "Sit down, darling.  Let me make you
some kind of a drink.  You're over-wrought."
</p>
<p>
Automatically, he scanned: "No I'm not!  Listen to
me.  How do you think it feels to be in the Up-and-Out
with the crew tied-for-space all around you?  How do
you think it feels to watch them sleep?  How do you think
I like scanning, scanning, scanning month after month,
when I can feel the pain-of-Space beating against every
part of my body, trying to get past my Haberman blocks?
How do you think I like to wake the men when I have to,
and have them hate me for it?  Have you ever seen
habermans fight—strong men fighting, and neither knowing
pain, fighting until one touches <i>Overload</i>?  Do you think
about that, Luci?"  Triumphantly he added: "Can you
blame me if I cranch, and come back to being a man, just
two days a month?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm not blaming you, darling.  Let's enjoy your
cranch.  Sit down now, and have a drink."
</p>
<p>
He was sitting down, resting his face in his hands,
while she fixed the drink, using natural fruits out of
bottles in addition to the secure alkaloids.  He watched her
restlessly and pitied her for marrying a scanner; and then,
though it was unjust, resented having to pity her.
</p>
<p>
Just as she turned to hand him the drink, they both
jumped a little as the phone rang.  It should not have
rung.  They had turned it off.  It rang again, obviously
on the emergency circuit.  Stepping ahead of Luci, Martel
strode over to the phone and looked into it.  Vomact was
looking at him.
</p>
<p>
The custom of Scanners entitled him to be brusque,
even with a Senior Scanner, on certain given occasions.
This was one.
</p>
<p>
Before Vomact could speak, Martel spoke two words
into the plate, not caring whether the old man could read
lips or not:
</p>
<p>
"Cranching.  Busy."
</p>
<p>
He cut the switch and went back to Luci.
</p>
<p>
The phone rang again.
</p>
<p>
Luci said, gently, "I can find out what it is, darling.
Here, take your drink and sit down."
</p>
<p>
"Leave it alone," said her husband.  "No one has a
right to call when I'm cranching.  He knows that.  He
ought to know that."
</p>
<p>
The phone rang again.  In a fury, Martel rose and went
to the plate.  He cut it back on.  Vomact was on the
screen.  Before Martel could speak, Vomact held up his
Talking Nail in line with his Heartbox.  Martel reverted
to discipline:
</p>
<p>
"Scanner Martel present and waiting, sir."
</p>
<p>
The lips moved solemnly: "Top emergency."
</p>
<p>
"Sir, I am under the wire."
</p>
<p>
"Top emergency."
</p>
<p>
"Sir, don't you understand?"  Martel mouthed his words,
so he could be sure that Vomact followed.  "I .... am .... under
.... the .... wire.  Unfit, for ... Space!"
</p>
<p>
Vomact repeated: "Top emergency.  Report to your
central tie-in."
</p>
<p>
"But, sir, no emergency like this—"
</p>
<p>
"Right, Martel.  No emergency like this, ever before.
Report to tie-in."  With a faint glint of kindliness, Vomact
added: "No need to de-cranch.  Report as you are."
</p>
<p>
This time it was Martel whose phone was cut out.  The
screen went gray.
</p>
<p>
He turned to Luci.  The temper had gone out of his
voice.  She came to him.  She kissed him, and rumpled
his hair.  All she could say was,
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry."
</p>
<p>
She kissed him again, knowing his disappointment.
"Take good care of yourself, darling.  I'll wait."
</p>
<p>
He scanned, and slipped into his transparent aircoat.
At the window he paused, and waved.  She called, "Good
luck!"  As the air flowed past him he said to himself,
"This is the first time I've felt flight in—eleven years.
Lord, but it's easy to fly if you can feel yourself live!"
</p>
<p>
Central Tie-in glowed white and austere far ahead.
Martel peered.  He saw no glare of incoming ships from
the Up-and-Out, no shuddering flare of Space-fire out of
control.  Everything was quiet, as it should be on an
off-duty night.
</p>
<p>
And vet Vomact had called.  He had called an emergency
higher than Space.  There was no such thing.  But
Vomact had called it.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>
<p>
When Martel got there, he found about half the Scanners
present, two dozen or so of them.  He lifted the Talking
finger.  Most of the Scanners were standing face to
face, talking in pairs as they read lips.  A few of the old,
impatient ones were scribbling on their Tablets and then
thrusting the Tablets into other people's faces.  All the
faces wore the dull dead relaxed look of a haberman.
When Martel entered the room, he knew that most of the
others laughed in the deep isolated privacy of their own
minds, each thinking things it would be useless to express
in formal words.  It had been a long time since a Scanner
showed up at a meeting cranched.
</p>
<p>
Vomact was not there: probably, thought Martel, he
was still on the phone calling others.  The light of the
phone flashed on and off; the bell rang.  Martel felt odd
when he realized that of all those present, he was the only
one to hear that loud bell.  It made him realize why ordinary
people did not like to be around groups of habermans
or Scanners.  Martel looked around for company.
</p>
<p>
His friend Chang was there, busy explaining to some
old and testy Scanner that he did not know why Vomact
had called.  Martel looked further and saw Parizianski.
He walked over, threading his way past the others with a
dexterity that showed he could feel his feet from the
inside, and did not have to watch them.  Several of the
others stared at him with their dead faces, and tried to
smile.  But they lacked full muscular control and their
faces twisted into horrid masks.  (Scanners knew better
than to show expression on faces which they could no
longer govern.  Martel added to himself, I swear <i>I'll</i> never
smile again unless I'm cranched.)
</p>
<p>
Parizianski gave him the sign of the Talking Finger.
Looking face to face, he spoke:
</p>
<p>
"You come here cranched?"
</p>
<p>
Parizianski could not hear his own voice, so the words
roared like the words on a broken and screeching phone;
Martel was startled, but knew that the inquiry was well
meant.  No one could be better-natured than the burly
Pole.
</p>
<p>
"Vomact called.  Top emergency."
</p>
<p>
"You told him you were cranched?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"He still made you come?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"Then all this—it is not for Space?  You could not go
Up-and-Out?  You are like ordinary men?"
</p>
<p>
"That's right."
</p>
<p>
"Then why did he call us?"  Some pre-Haberman
habit made Parizianski wave his arms in inquiry.  The
hand struck the back of the old man behind them.  The
slap could be heard throughout the room, but only Martel
heard it.  Instinctively, he scanned Parizianski and the
old Scanner: they scanned him back, and then asked why.
Only then did the old man ask why Martel had scanned
him.  When Martel explained that he was under-the-wire,
the old man moved swiftly away to pass on the news that
there was a cranched Scanner present at the Tie-in.
</p>
<p>
Even this minor sensation could not keep the attention
of most of the Scanners from the worry about the Top
Emergency.  One young man, who had Scanned his first
transit just the year before, dramatically interposed
himself between Parizianski and Martel.  He dramatically
flashed his Tablet at them:
</p>
<p>
<i>Is Vmct mad?</i>
</p>
<p>
The older men shook their heads.  Martel, remembering
that it had not been too long that the young man had been
haberman, mitigated the dead solemnity of the denial with
a friendly smile.  He spoke in a normal voice, saying:
</p>
<p>
"Vomact is the Senior of Scanners.  I am sure that he
could not go mad.  Would he not see it on his boxes
first?"
</p>
<p>
Martel had to repeat the question, speaking slowly and
mouthing his words before the young Scanner could
understand the comment.  The young man tried to make
his face smile, and twisted it into a comic mask.  But he
took up his tablet and scribbled:
</p>
<p>
<i>Yr rght.</i>
</p>
<p>
Chang broke away from his friend and came over, his
half-Chinese face gleaming in the warm evening.  (It's
strange, thought Martel that more Chinese don't become
scanners.  Or not so strange perhaps, if you think that
they never fill their quota of habermans.  Chinese love
good living too much.  The ones who do scan are all good
ones.)  Chang saw that Martel was cranched, and spoke
with voice:
</p>
<p>
"You break precedents.  Luci must be angry to lose you?"
</p>
<p>
"She took it well.  Chang, that's strange."
</p>
<p>
"What?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm cranched, and I can hear.  Your voice sounds all
right.  How did you learn to talk like—like an ordinary
person?"
</p>
<p>
"I practised with soundtracks.  Funny you noticed it.
I think I am the only Scanner in or between the Earths
who can pass for an Ordinary Man.  Mirrors and
sound-tracks.  I found out how to act."
</p>
<p>
"But you don't....?"
</p>
<p>
"No.  I don't feel, or taste, or hear, or smell things,
any more than you do.  Talking doesn't do me much
good.  But I notice that it cheers up the people around
me."
</p>
<p>
"It would make a difference in the life of Luci."
</p>
<p>
Chang nodded sagely.  "My father insisted on it.  He
said, 'You may be proud of being a Scanner.  I am sorry
you are not a Man.  Conceal your defects.'  So I tried.
I wanted to tell the old boy about the Up and Out, and
what we did there, but it did not matter.  He said,
'Airplanes were good enough for Confucius, and they are for
me too.'  The old humbug!  He tries so hard to be a
Chinese when he can't even read Old Chinese.  But he's
got wonderful good sense, and for somebody going on
two hundred he certainly gets around."
</p>
<p>
Martel smiled at the thought: "In his airplane?"
</p>
<p>
Chang smiled back.  This discipline of his facial muscles
was amazing; a bystander would not think that Chang
was a haberman, controlling his eyes, cheeks, and lips by
cold intellectual control.  The expression had the spontaneity
of life.  Martel felt a flash of envy for Chang when
he looked at the dead cold faces of Parizianski and the
others.  He knew that he himself looked fine: but why
shouldn't he? he was cranched.  Turning to Parizianski
he said,
</p>
<p>
"Did you see what Chang said about his father?  The
old boy uses an airplane."
</p>
<p>
Parizianski made motions with his mouth, but the
sounds meant nothing.  He took up his tablet and showed
it to Martel and Chang.
</p>
<p>
<i>Bzz bzz.  Ha ha.  Gd ol' boy.</i>
</p>
<p>
At that moment, Martel heard steps out in the corridor.
He could not help looking toward the door.  Other eyes
followed the direction of his glance.
</p>
<p>
Vomact came in.
</p>
<p>
The group shuffled to attention in four parallel lines.
They scanned one another.  Numerous hands reached
across to adjust the electrochemical controls on
chestboxes which had begun to load up.  One Scanner held
out a broken finger which his counter-Scanner had
discovered, and submitted it for treatment and splinting.
</p>
<p>
Vomact had taken out his Staff of Office.  The cube
at the top flashed red light through the room, the lines
reformed, and all Scanners gave the sign meaning
</p>
<p>
<i>Present and ready!</i>
</p>
<p>
Vomact countered with the stance signifying, <i>I am the
Senior and take Command.</i>
</p>
<p>
Talking fingers rose in the counter-gesture, <i>We concur
and commit ourselves.</i>
</p>
<p>
Vomact raised his right arm, dropped the wrist as
though it were broken, in a queer searching gesture,
meaning: <i>Any men around?  Any habermans not tied?
All clear for the Scanners?</i>
</p>
<p>
Alone of all those present, the cranched Martel heard
the queer rustle of feet as they all turned completely
around without leaving position, looking sharply at one
another and flashing their beltlights into the dark corners
of the great room.  When again they faced Vomact, he
made a further sign:
</p>
<p>
<i>All clear.  Follow my words.</i>
</p>
<p>
Martel noticed that he alone relaxed.  The others
could not know the meaning of relaxation with the minds
blocked off up there in their skulls, connected only with
the eyes, and the rest of the body connected with the mind
only by controlling non-sensory nerves and the instrument
boxes on their chests.  Martel realized that, cranched
as he was, he expected to hear Vomact's voice: the Senior
had been talking for some time.  No sound escaped his
lips.  (Vomact never bothered with sound.)
</p>
<p>
"...and when the first men to go Up and Out went to
the Moon, what did they find?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing," responded the silent chorus of lips.
</p>
<p>
"Therefore they went further, to Mars and to Venus.
The ships went out year by year, but they did not come
back until the Year One of Space.  Then did a ship come
back with the First Effect.  Scanners, I ask you, what
is the First Effect?"
</p>
<p>
"No one knows.  No one knows."
</p>
<p>
"No one will ever know.  Too many are the variables.
By what do we know the First Effect?"
</p>
<p>
"By the Great Pain of Space," came the chorus.
</p>
<p>
"And by what further sign?"
</p>
<p>
"By the need, oh the need for death."
</p>
<p>
Vomact again: "And who stopped the need for death?"
</p>
<p>
"Henry Haberman conquered the first effect, in the
Year 3 of Space."
</p>
<p>
"And, Scanners, I ask you, what did he do?"
</p>
<p>
"He made the habermans."
</p>
<p>
"How, O Scanners, are habermans made?"
</p>
<p>
"They are made with the cuts.  The brain is cut from
the heart, the lungs.  The brain is cut from the ears, the
nose.  The brain is cut from the mouth, the belly.  The
brain is cut from desire, and pain.  The brain is cut from
the world.  Save for the eyes.  Save for the control of
the living flesh."
</p>
<p>
"And how, O Scanners is flesh controlled?"
</p>
<p>
"By the boxes set in the flesh, the controls set in the
chest, the signs made to rule the living body, the signs by
which the body lives."
</p>
<p>
"How does a haberman live and live?"
</p>
<p>
"The haberman lives by control of the boxes."
</p>
<p>
"Whence come the habermans?"
</p>
<p>
Martel felt in the coming response a great roar of
broken voices echoing through the room as the Scanners,
habermans themselves, put sound behind their mouthings:
</p>
<p>
"Habermans are the scum of Mankind.  Habermans
are the weak, the cruel the credulous, and the unfit.
Habermans are the sentenced-to-more-than-death.  Habermans
live in the mind alone.  They are killed for Space
but they live for Space.  They master the ships that
connect the earths.  They live in the Great Pain while
ordinary men sleep in the cold cold sleep of the transit."
</p>
<p>
"Brothers and Scanners, I ask you now: are we habermans
or are we not?"
</p>
<p>
"We are habermans in the flesh.  We are cut apart,
brain and flesh.  We are ready to go to the Up and Out.
All of us have gone through the Haberman Device."
</p>
<p>
"We are habermans then?"  Vomact's eyes flashed and
glittered as he asked the ritual question.
</p>
<p>
Again the chorused answer was accompanied by a roar
of voices heard only by Martel: "Habermans we are, and
more, and more.  We are the Chosen who are habermans
by our own free will.  We are the Agents of the
Instrumentality of Mankind."
</p>
<p>
"What must the others say to us?"
</p>
<p>
"They must say to us, 'You are the bravest of the
brave, the most skilful of the skilled.  All mankind owes
most honor to the Scanner, who unites the Earths of
Mankind.  Scanners are the protectors of the habermans.  They
are the judges in the Up-and-Out.  They make men live
in the place where men need desperately to die.  They
are the most honored of Mankind, and even the Chiefs of
the Instrumentality are delighted to pay them homage!'"
</p>
<p>
Vomact stood more erect: "What is the secret duty of
the Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"To keep secret our law, and to destroy the acquirers
thereof."
</p>
<p>
"How to destroy?"
</p>
<p>
"Twice to the <i>Overload</i>, back and <i>Dead</i>."
</p>
<p>
"If habermans die, what the duty then?"
</p>
<p>
The Scanners all compressed their lips for answer.
(Silence was the code.)  Martel, who—long familiar with the
code—was a little bored with the proceedings, noticed
that Chang was breathing too heavily; he reached over
and adjusted Chang's Lung-control and received the
thanks of Chang's eyes.  Vomact observed the interruption
and glared at them both.  Martel relaxed, trying to
imitate the dead cold stillness of the others.  It was so
hard to do, when you were cranched.
</p>
<p>
"If others die, what the duty then?" asked Vomact.
</p>
<p>
"Scanners together inform the Instrumentality.
Scanners together accept the punishment.  Scanners together
settle the case."
</p>
<p>
"And if the punishment be severe?"
</p>
<p>
"Then no ships go."
</p>
<p>
"And if Scanners not be honored?"
</p>
<p>
"Then no ships go."
</p>
<p>
"And if a Scanner goes unpaid?"
</p>
<p>
"Then no ships go."
</p>
<p>
"And if the Others and the Instrumentality are not in
all ways at all times mindful of their proper obligation to
the Scanners?"
</p>
<p>
"Then no ships go."
</p>
<p>
"And what, O Scanners, if no ships go?"
</p>
<p>
"The Earths fall apart.  The Wild comes back in.  The
Old Machines and the Beasts return."
</p>
<p>
"What is the known duty of a Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"Not to sleep in the Up-and-Out."
</p>
<p>
"What is the second duty of a Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"To keep forgotten the name of fear."
</p>
<p>
"What is the third duty of a Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"To use the wire of Eustace Cranch only with care,
only with moderation."  Several pair of eyes looked
quickly at Martel before the mouthed chorus went on.  "To
cranch only at home, only among friends, only for the
purpose of remembering, of relaxing, or of begetting."
</p>
<p>
"What is the word of the Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"Faithful though surrounded by death."
</p>
<p>
"What is the motto of the Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"Awake though surrounded by silence."
</p>
<p>
"What is the work of the Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"Labor even in the heights of the Up-and-Out, loyalty
even in the depths of the Earths."
</p>
<p>
"How do you know a Scanner?"
</p>
<p>
"We know ourselves.  We are dead though we live.
And we Talk with the Tablet and the Nail."
</p>
<p>
"What is this Code?"
</p>
<p>
"This Code is the friendly ancient wisdom of Scanners,
briefly put that we may be mindful and be cheered by our
loyalty to one another."
</p>
<p>
At this point the formula should have run: "We complete
the Code.  Is there work or word for the Scanners?"  But
Vomact said, and he repeated:
</p>
<p>
"Top emergency.  Top emergency."
</p>
<p>
They gave him the sign, <i>Present and ready!</i>
</p>
<p>
He said, with every eye straining to follow his lips:
</p>
<p>
"Some of you know the work of Adam Stone?"
</p>
<p>
Martel saw lips move, saying: "The Red Asteroid.  The
Other who lives at the edge of Space."
</p>
<p>
"Adam Stone has gone to the Instrumentality, claiming
success for his work.  He says that he has found how to
Screen Out the Pain of Space.  He says that the Up-and-Out
can be made safe for ordinary men to work in, to stay
awake in.  He says that there need be no more Scanners."
</p>
<p>
Beltlights flashed on all over the room as Scanners
sought the right to speak.  Vomact nodded to one of the
older men.  "Scanner Smith will speak."
</p>
<p>
Smith stepped slowly up into the light, watching his
own feet.  He turned so that they could see his face.  He
spoke: "I say that this is a lie.  I say that Stone is a liar.
I say that the Instrumentality must not be deceived."
</p>
<p>
He paused.  Then, in answer to some question from
the audience which most of the others did not see, he said:
</p>
<p>
"I invoke the secret duty of the Scanners."
</p>
<p>
Smith raised his right hand for Emergency Attention:
</p>
<p>
"I say that Stone must die."
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>

</h3>
<p>
Martel, still cranched, shuddered as he heard the boos,
groans, shouts, squeaks, grunts and moans which came
from the Scanners who forgot noise in their excitement
and strove to make their dead bodies talk to one another's
deaf ears.  Beltlights flashed wildly all over the room.
There was a rush for the rostrum and Scanners milled
around at the top, vying for attention until Parizianski—by
sheer bulk—shoved the others aside and down, and
turned to mouth at the group.
</p>
<p>
"Brother Scanners, I want your eyes."
</p>
<p>
The people on the floor kept moving, with their numb
bodies jostling one another.  Finally Vomact stepped up
in front of Parizianski, faced the others, and said:
</p>
<p>
"Scanners, be Scanners!  Give him your eyes."
</p>
<p>
Parizianski was not good at public speaking.  His lips
moved too fast.  He waved his hands, which took the eyes
of the others away from his lips.  Nevertheless, Martel
was able to follow most of the message:
</p>
<p>
"...can't do this.  Stone may have succeeded.  If he
has succeeded, it means the end of the Scanners.  It means
the end of the habermans, too.  None of us will have to
fight in the Up-and-Out.  We won't have anybody else
going under-the-Wire for a few hours or days of being
human.  Everybody will be Other.  Nobody will have to
Cranch, never again.  Men can be men.  The habermans
can be killed decently and properly, the way men were
killed in the Old Days, without anybody keeping them
alive.  They won't have to work in the Up-and-Out!
There will be no more Great Pain—think of it!  No
... more ... Great ... Pain!  How do we know that Stone is
a liar—"  Lights began flashing directly into his eyes.
(The rudest insult of Scanner to Scanner was this.)
</p>
<p>
Vomact again exercized authority.  He stepped in front
of Parizianski and said something which the others could
not see.  Parizianski stepped down from the rostrum.
Vomact again spoke:
</p>
<p>
"I think that some of the Scanners disagree with our
Brother Parizianski.  I say that the use of the rostrum
be suspended till we have had a chance for private
discussion.  In fifteen minutes I will call the meeting back
to order."
</p>
<p>
Martel looked around for Vomact when the Senior had
rejoined the group on the floor.  Finding the Senior,
Martel wrote swift script on his Tablet, waiting for a
chance to thrust the Tablet before the Senior's eyes.  He
had written,
</p>
<p>
<i>Am crcnhd.  Rspctfly requst prmissn lv now, stnd by
fr orders.</i>
</p>
<p>
Being cranched did strange things to Martel Most
meetings that he attended seemed formal heartening
ceremonial, lighting up the dark inward eternities of
habermanhood.  When he was not cranched, he noticed his body
no more than a marble bust notices its marble pedestal.
He had stood with them before.  He had stood with them
effortless hours, while the long-winded ritual broke
through the terrible loneliness behind his eyes, and made
him feel that the Scanners, though a confraternity of the
damned, were none the less forever honored by the
professional requirements of their mutilation.
</p>
<p>
This time, it was different.  Coming cranched, and in
full possession of smell-sound-taste-feeling, he reacted
more or less as a normal man would.  He saw his friends
and colleagues as a lot of cruelly driven ghosts, posturing
out the meaningless ritual of their indefeasible damnation.
What difference did anything make, once you were a
haberman?  Why all this talk about habermans and
Scanners?  Habermans were criminals or heretics, and
Scanners were gentlemen-volunteers, but they were all in
the same fix—except that Scanners were deemed worthy
of the short-time return of the Cranching Wire, while
habermans were simply disconnected while the ships lay
in port and were left suspended until they should be
awakened, in some hour of emergency or trouble, to work
out another spell of their damnation.  It was a rare
haberman that you saw on the street—someone of special merit
or bravery, allowed to look at mankind from the terrible
prison of his own mechanified body.  And yet, what
Scanner ever pitied a haberman?  What Scanner ever honored
a haberman except perfunctorily in the line of duty?  What
had the Scanners as a guild and a class, ever done for the
habermans, except to murder them with a twist of the
wrist whenever a haberman, too long beside a Scanner,
picked up the tricks of the Scanning trade and learned
how to live at his own will, not the will the Scanners
imposed?  What could the Others, the ordinary men,
know of what went on inside the ships?  The Others
slept in their cylinders, mercifully unconscious until they
woke up on whatever other Earth they had consigned
themselves to.  What could the Others know of the men
who had to stay alive within the ship?
</p>
<p>
What could any Other know of the Up-and-Out?  What
Other could look at the biting acid beauty of the stars in
open space?  What could they tell of the Great Pain, which
started quietly in the marrow, like an ache, and proceeded
by the fatigue and nausea of each separate nerve cell, brain
cell, touchpoint in the body, until life itself became a
terrible aching hunger for silence and for death?
</p>
<p>
He was a Scanner.  All right, he was a Scanner.  He
had been a Scanner from the moment when, wholly normal,
he had stood in the sunlight before a Subchief of
Instrumentality, and had sworn:
</p>
<p>
"I pledge my honor and my life to Mankind.  I sacrifice
myself willingly for the welfare of Mankind.  In
accepting the perilous austere Honor, I yield all my rights
without exception to the Honorable Chiefs of the
Instrumentality and to the Honored Confraternity of Scanners."
</p>
<p>
He had pledged.
</p>
<p>
He had gone into the Haberman Device.
</p>
<p>
He remembered his Hell.  He had not had such a bad
one, even though it had seemed to last a hundred million
years, all of them without sleep.  He had learned to feel
with his eyes.  He had learned to see despite the heavy
eyeplates set back of his eyeballs, to insulate his eyes from
the rest of him.  He had learned to watch his skin.  He
still remembered the time he had noticed dampness on his
shirt, and had pulled out his Scanning Mirror only to
discover that he had worn a hole in his side by leaning
against a vibrating machine.  (A thing like that could
not happen to him now; he was too adept at reading his
own instruments.)  He remembered the way that he had
gone Up-and-Out, and the way that the Great Pain beat
into him, despite the fact that his touch, smell, feeling,
and hearing were gone for all ordinary purposes.  He
remembered killing habermans, and keeping others alive,
and standing for months beside the Honorable Scanner-Pilot
while neither of them slept.  He remembered going
ashore on Earth Four, and remembered that he had not
enjoyed it, and had realized on that day that there was no
reward.
</p>
<p>
Martel stood among the other Scanners.  He hated
their awkwardness when they moved, their immobility
when they stood still.  He hated the queer assortment of
smells which their bodies yielded unnoticed.  He hated
the grunts and groans and squawks which they emitted
from their deafness.  He hated them, and himself.
</p>
<p>
How could Luci stand him?  He had kept his chestbox
reading Danger for weeks while he courted her, carrying
the Cranch Wire about with him most illegally, and
going direct from one cranch to the other without worrying
about the fact his indicators all crept up to the edge
of <i>Overload</i>.  He had wooed her without thinking of
what would happen if she did say, "Yes."  She had.
</p>
<p>
"And they lived happily ever after."  In Old Books
they did, but how could they, in life?  He had had
eighteen days under-the-wire in the whole of the past
year!  Yet she had loved him.  She still loved him.  He
knew it.  She fretted about him through the long months
that he was in the Up-and-Out.  She tried to make home
mean something to him even when he was haberman,
make food pretty when it could not be tasted, make
herself lovable when she could not be kissed—or might as
well not, since a haberman body meant no more than
furniture.  Luci was patient.
</p>
<p>
And now, Adam Stone!  (He let his Tablet fade: how
could he leave, now?)
</p>
<p>
God bless Adam Stone?
</p>
<p>
Martel could not help feeling a little sorry for himself.
No longer would the high keen call of duty carry him
through two hundred or so years of the Other's time, two
million private eternities of his own.  He could slouch and
relax.  He could forget High Space, and let the Up-and-Out
be tended by Others.  He could cranch as much as
he dared.  He could be almost normal—almost—for one
year or five years or no years.  But at least he could stay
with Luci.  He could go with her into the Wild, where
there were Beasts and Old Machines still roving the dark
places.  Perhaps he would die in the excitement of the
hunt, throwing spears at an ancient Manshonjagger as it
leapt from its lair, or tossing hot spheres at the tribesmen
of the Unforgiven who still roamed the Wild.  There was
still life to live, still a good normal death to die, not the
moving of a needle out in the silence and pain of Space!
</p>
<p>
He had been walking about restlessly.  His ears were
attuned to the sounds of normal speech, so that he did not
feel like watching the mouthings of his brethern.  Now
they seemed to have come to a decision.  Vomact was
moving to the rostrum.  Martel looked about for Chang,
and went to stand beside him.  Chang whispered.
</p>
<p>
"You're as restless as water in mid-air!  What's the
matter?  De-cranching?"
</p>
<p>
They both scanned Martel, but the instruments held
steady and showed no sign of the cranch giving out.
</p>
<p>
The great light flared in its call to attention.  Again
they formed ranks.  Vomact thrust his lean old face into
the glare, and spoke:
</p>
<p>
"Scanners and Brothers, I call for a vote."  He held
himself in the stance which meant: "<i>I am the Senior and
take Command</i>."
</p>
<p>
A beltlight flashed in protest.
</p>
<p>
It was old Henderson.  He moved to the rostrum,
spoke to Vomact, and—with Vomact's nod of
approval—turned full-face to repeat his question:
</p>
<p>
"Who speaks for the Scanners Out in Space?"
</p>
<p>
No beltlight or hand answered.
</p>
<p>
Henderson and Vomact, face to face, conferred for a
few moments.  Then Henderson faced them again:
</p>
<p>
"I yield to the Senior in Command.  But I do not yield
to a Meeting of the Confraternity.  There are sixty-eight
Scanners, and only forty-seven present, of whom one is
cranched and U.D.  I have therefore proposed that the
Senior in Command assume authority only over an
Emergency Committee of the Confraternity, not over a
Meeting.  Is that agreed and understood by the Honorable
Scanners?"
</p>
<p>
Hands rose in assent.
</p>
<p>
Chang murmured in Martel's ear, "Lot of difference
that makes!  Who can tell the difference between a
meeting and a committee?"  Martel agreed with the words,
but was even more impressed with the way that Chang,
while haberman, could control his own voice.
</p>
<p>
Vomact resumed chairmanship: "We now vote on the
question of Adam Stone.
</p>
<p>
"First, we can assume that he has not succeeded, and
that his claims are lies.  We know that from our practical
experience as Scanners.  The Pain of Space is only part
of Scanning" (<i>But the essential part, the basis of it all</i>,
thought Martel.) "and we can rest assured that Stone
cannot solve the problem of Space Discipline."
</p>
<p>
"That tripe again," whispered Chang, unheard save by
Martel.
</p>
<p>
"The Space Discipline of our Confraternity has kept
High Space clean of war and dispute.  Sixty-eight
disciplined men control all High Space.  We are removed by
our oath and our haberman status from all Earthly passions.
</p>
<p>
"Therefore, if Adam Stone has conquered the Pain of
Space, so that Others can wreck our Confraternity and
bring to Space the trouble and ruin which afflicts Earths,
I say that Adam Stone is wrong.  If Adam Stone succeeds,
Scanners live in Vain!
</p>
<p>
"Secondly, if Adam Stone has not conquered the Pain
of Space, he will cause great trouble in all the Earths.
The Instrumentality and the Subchiefs may not give us as
many habermans as we need to operate the ships of Mankind.
There will be wild stories, and fewer recruits and,
worst of all, the Discipline of the Confraternity may relax
if this kind of nonsensical heresy is spread around.
</p>
<p>
"Therefore, if Adam Stone has succeeded, he threatens
the ruin of the Confraternity and should die.
</p>
<p>
"I move the death of Adam Stone."
</p>
<p>
And Vomact made the sign, <i>The Honorable Scanners
are pleased to vote</i>.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>
<h3>

</h3>
<p>
Martel grabbed wildly for his beltlight.  Chang, guessing
ahead, had his light out and ready; its bright beam,
voting No, shone straight up at the ceiling.  Martel got
his light out and threw its beam upward in dissent.  Then
he looked around.  Out of the forty-seven present, he
could see only five or six glittering.
</p>
<p>
Two more lights went on.  Vomact stood as erect as
a frozen corpse.  Vomact's eyes flashed as he stared back
and forth over the group, looking for lights.  Several
more went on.  Finally Vomact took the closing stance:
</p>
<p>
<i>May it please the Scanners to count the vote</i>.
</p>
<p>
Three of the older men went up on the rostrum with
Vomact.  They looked over the room.  (Martel thought:
<i>These damned ghosts are voting on the life of a real man,
a live man!  They have no right to do it.  I'll tell the
Instrumentality!</i>  But he knew that he would not.  He
thought of Luci and what she might gain by the triumph
of Adam Stone: the heartbreaking folly of the vote was
then almost too much for Martel to bear.)
</p>
<p>
All three of the tellers held up their hands in
unanimous agreement on the sign of the number: Fifteen
against.
</p>
<p>
Vomact dismissed them with a bow of courtesy.  He
turned and again took the stance, <i>I am the Senior and
take Command</i>.
</p>
<p>
Marvelling at his own daring, Martel flashed his
beltlight on.  He knew that anyone of the bystanders might
reach over and twist his Heartbox to Overload for such
an act.  He felt Chang's hand reaching to catch him by the
aircoat.  But he eluded Chang's grasp and ran, faster than
a Scanner should, to the platform.  As he ran, he
wondered what appeal to make.  It was no use talking
commonsense.  Not now.  It had to be law.
</p>
<p>
He jumped up on the rostrum beside Vomact, and took
the stance: Scanners, an Illegality!
</p>
<p>
He violated good custom while speaking, still in the
stance: "A Committee has no right to vote death by a
majority vote.  It takes two-thirds of a full Meeting."
</p>
<p>
He felt Vomact's body lunge behind him, felt himself
falling from the rostrum, hitting the floor, hurting his
knees and his touch-aware hands.  He was helped to his
feet.  He was scanned.  Some Scanner he scarcely knew
took his instruments and toned him down.
</p>
<p>
Immediately Martel felt more calm, more detached, and
hated himself for feeling so.
</p>
<p>
He looked up at the rostrum.  Vomact maintained the
stance signifying: <i>Order!</i>
</p>
<p>
The Scanners adjusted their ranks.  The two Scanners
next to Martel took his arms.  He shouted at them, but
they looked away, and cut themselves off from
communication altogether.
</p>
<p>
Vomact spoke again when he saw the room was quiet:
"A Scanner came here cranched.  Honorable Scanners,
I apologize for this.  It is not the fault of our great and
worthy Scanner and friend, Martel.  He came here under
orders.  I told him not to de-cranch.  I hoped to spare
him an unnecessary haberman.  We all know how happily
Martel is married, and we wish his brave experiment well.
I like Martel.  I respect his judgment.  I wanted him
here.  I knew you wanted him here.  But he is cranched.
He is in no mood to share in the lofty business of the
Scanners.  I therefore propose a solution which will meet
all the requirements of fairness.  I propose that we rule
Scanner Martel out of order for his violation of rules.
This violation would be inexcusable if Martel were not
cranched.
</p>
<p>
"But at the same time, in all fairness to Martel, I
further propose that we deal with the points raised so
improperly by our worthy but disqualified brother."
</p>
<p>
Vomact gave the sign, <i>The Honorable Scanners are
pleased to vote</i>.  Martel tried to reach his own beltlight;
the dead strong hands held him tightly and he struggled
in vain.  One lone light shone high: Chang's, no doubt.
</p>
<p>
Vomact thrust his face into the light again: "Having
the approval of our worthy Scanners and present company
for the general proposal, I now move that this Committee
declare itself to have the full authority of a Meeting, and
that this Committee further make me responsible for all
misdeeds which this Committee may enact, to be held
answerable before the next full Meeting, but not before any
other authority beyond the closed and secret ranks of
Scanners."
</p>
<p>
Flamboyantly this time, his triumph evident, Vomact
assumed the vote stance.
</p>
<p>
Only a few lights shone: far less, patently, than a
minority of one-fourth.
</p>
<p>
Vomact spoke again.  The light shone on his high calm
forehead, on his dead relaxed cheekbones.  His lean
cheeks and chin were half-shadowed, save where the lower
light picked up and spotlighted his mouth, cruel even in
repose.  (Vomact was said to be a descendant of some
Ancient Lady who had traversed, in an illegitimate and
inexplicable fashion, some hundreds of years of time in a
single night.  Her name, the Lady Vomact, had passed
into legend; but her blood and her archaic lust for
mastery lived on in the mute masterful body of her descendent.
Martel could believe the old tales as he stared at the
rostrum, wondering what untraceable mutation had left the
Vomact kith as predators among mankind.)  Calling
loudly with the movement of his lips, but still without
sound, Vomact appealed:
</p>
<p>
"The Honorable Committee is now pleased to reaffirm
the sentence of death issued against the heretic and
enemy, Adam Stone."  Again the <i>vote</i> stance.
</p>
<p>
Again Chang's light shone lonely in its isolated protest.
</p>
<p>
Vomact then made his final move:
</p>
<p>
"I call for the designation of the Senior Scanner present
as the manager of the sentence.  I call for authorization
to him to appoint executioners, one or many, who shall
make evident the will and majesty of Scanners.  I ask
that I be accountable for the deed, and not for the means.
The deed is a noble deed, for the protection of Mankind
and for the honor of the Scanners; but of the means it
must be said that they are to be the best at hand, and no
more.  Who knows the true way to kill an Other, here
on a crowded and watchful earth?  This is no mere
matter of discharging a cylindered sleeper, no mere question
of upgrading the needle of a haberman.  When people die
down here, it is not like the Up-and-Out.  They die
reluctantly.  Killing within the Earth is not our usual
business, O brothers and Scanners, as you know well.
You must choose me to choose my agent as I see fit.
Otherwise the common knowledge will become the common
betrayal whereas if I alone know the responsibility, I alone
could betray us, and you will not have far to look in case
the Instrumentality comes searching."  (<i>What about the
killer you choose? thought Martel.  He too will know
unless—unless you silence him forever.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Vomact went into the stance, The Honorable Scanners
are pleased to vote.
</p>
<p>
One light of protest shone; Chang's, again.
</p>
<p>
Martel imagined that he could see a cruel joyful smile
on Vomact's dead face—the smile of a man who knew
himself righteous and who found his righteousness upheld
and affirmed by militant authority.
</p>
<p>
Martel tried one last time to come free.
</p>
<p>
The dead hands held.  They were locked like vises until
their owners' eyes unlocked them: how else could they
hold the piloting month by month?
</p>
<p>
Martel then shouted: "Honorable Scanners, this is
judicial murder."
</p>
<p>
No ear heard him.  He was cranched, and alone.
</p>
<p>
None the less, he shouted again: "You endanger the
confraternity."
</p>
<p>
Nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
The echo of his voice sounded from one end of the
room to the other.  No head turned.  No eyes met his.
</p>
<p>
Martel realized that as they paired for talk, the eyes of
the Scanners averted him.  He saw that no one desired
to watch his speech.  He knew that behind the cold faces
of his friends there lay compassion or amusement.  He
knew that they knew him to be cranched—absurd, normal,
man-like, temporarily no Scanner.  But he knew that
in this matter the wisdom of Scanners was nothing.  He
knew that only a cranched Scanner could feel with his
very blood the outrage and anger which deliberate
murder would provoke among the Others.  He knew that the
Confraternity endangered itself, and knew that the most
ancient prerogative of law was the monopoly of death.
Even the Ancient Nations, in the times of the Wars,
before the Beasts, before men went into the Up-and-Out—even
the Ancients had known this.  How did they say it?
<i>Only the State shall kill</i>.  The States were gone but the
Instrumentality remained, and the Instrumentality could
not pardon things which occurred within the Earths but
beyond its authority.  Death in Space was the business,
the right of the Scanners: how could the Instrumentality
enforce its laws in a place where all men who wakened,
wakened only to die in the Great Pain?  Wisely did the
Instrumentality leave Space to the Scanners, wisely had
the Confraternity not meddled inside the Earths.  And
now the Confraternity itself was going to step forth as an
outlaw band, as a gang of rogues as stupid and reckless
as the tribes of the unforgiven!
</p>
<p>
Martel knew this because he was cranched.  Had he
been haberman, he would have thought only with his
mind, not with his heart and guts and blood.  How could
the other Scanners know?
</p>
<p>
Vomact returned for the last time to the Rostrum: <i>The
Committee has met and its will shall be done</i>.  Verbally
he added: "Senior among you, I ask your loyalty and
your silence."
</p>
<p>
At that point, the two Scanners let his arms go.  Martel
rubbed his numb hands, shaking his fingers to get the
circulation back into the cold fingertips.  With real freedom,
he began to think of what he might still do.  He scanned
himself: the cranching held.  He might have a day.  Well,
he could go on even if haberman, but it would be
inconvenient, having to talk with Finger and Tablet.  He
looked about for Chang.  He saw his friend standing
patient and immobile in a quiet corner.  Martel moved
slowly, so as not to attract any more attention to himself
than could be helped.  He faced Chang, moved until his
face was in the light, and then articulated:
</p>
<p>
"What are we going to do?  You're not going to let
them kill Adam Stone, are you?  Don't you realize what
Stone's work will mean to us, if it succeeds?  No more
Scanners.  No more habermans.  No more Pain in the
Up-and-Out.  I tell you, if the others were all cranched,
as I am, they would see it in a human way, not with the
narrow crazy logic which they used in the meeting.  We've
got to stop them.  How can we do it?  What are we
going to do?  What does Parizianski think?  Who has
been chosen?"
</p>
<p>
"Which question do you want me to answer?"
</p>
<p>
Martel laughed.  (It felt good to laugh, even then; it
felt like being a man.)  "Will you help me?"
</p>
<p>
Chang's eyes flashed across Martel's face as Chang
answered: "No.  No.  No."
</p>
<p>
"You won't help?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"Why not, Chang?  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"I am a Scanner.  The vote has been taken.  You would
do the same if you were not in this unusual condition."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not in an unusual condition.  I'm cranched.  That
merely means that I see things the way that the Others
would.  I see the stupidity.  The recklessness.  The
selfishness.  It is murder."
</p>
<p>
"What is murder?  Have you not killed?  You are not
one of the Others.  You are a Scanner.  You will be
sorry for what you are about to do, if you do not watch
out."
</p>
<p>
"But why did you vote against Vomact then?  Didn't
you too see what Adam Stone means to all of us?
Scanners will live in vain.  Thank God for that!  Can't you
see it?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"But you talk to me, Chang.  You are my friend?"
</p>
<p>
"I talk to you.  I am your friend.  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"But what are you going to do?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing, Martel.  Nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Will you help me?"
</p>
<p>
"No,"
</p>
<p>
"Not even to save Stone?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"Then I will go to Parizianski for help."
</p>
<p>
"It will do you no good."
</p>
<p>
"Why not?  He's more human than you, right now."
</p>
<p>
"He will not help you, because he has the job.  Vomact
designated him to kill Adam Stone."
</p>
<p>
Martel stopped speaking in mid-movement.  He suddenly
took the stance, <i>I thank you, brother, and I depart</i>.
</p>
<p>
At the window he turned and faced the room.  He saw
that Vomact's eyes were upon him.  He gave the stance,
<i>I thank you, brother, and I depart</i>, and added the flourish
of respect which is shown when Seniors are present.
Vomact caught the sign, and Martel could see the cruel lips
move.  He thought he saw the words "...take good care
of yourself...." but did not wait to inquire.  He stepped
backward and dropped out the window.
</p>
<p>
Once below the window and out of sight, he adjusted
his aircoat to maximum speed.  He swam lazily in the
air, scanning himself thoroughly, and adjusting his
adrenal intake down.  He then made the movement of release,
and felt the cold air rush past his face like running water.
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone had to be at Chief Downport.
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone had to be there.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn't Adam Stone be surprised in the night?  Surprised
to meet the strangest of beings, the first renegade
among Scanners.  (Martel suddenly appreciated that it
was of himself he was thinking.  Martel the Traitor to
Scanners!  That sounded strange and bad.  But what
of Martel, the Loyal to Mankind?  Was that not compensation?
And if he won, he won Luci.  If he lost, he lost
nothing—an unconsidered and expendable haberman.  It
happened to be himself.  But in contrast to the immense
reward, to Mankind, to the Confraternity, to Luci, what
did that matter?)
</p>
<p>
Martel thought to himself: "Adam Stone will have two
visitors tonight.  Two Scanners, who are the friends of
one another."  He hoped that Parizianski was still his
friend.
</p>
<p>
"And the world," he added, "depends on which of us
gets there first."
</p>
<p>
Multifaceted in their brightness, the lights of Chief
Downport began to shine through the mist ahead.  Martel
could see the outer towers of the city and glimpsed the
phosphorescent Periphery which kept back the wild,
whether Beasts, Machines, or the Unforgiven.
</p>
<p>
Once more Martel invoked the lords of his chance:
"Help me to pass for an Other!"
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>
<h3>
5
</h3>
<p>
Within the Downport, Martel had less trouble than he
thought.  He draped his aircoat over his shoulder so that
it concealed the instruments.  He took up his scanning
mirror, and made up his face from the inside, by adding
tone and animation to his blood and nerves until the
muscles of his face glowed and the skin gave out a healthy
sweat.  That way he looked like an ordinary man who
had just completed a long night flight.
</p>
<p>
After straightening out his clothing, and hiding his
tablet within his jacket, he faced the problem of what to
do about the Talking Finger.  If he kept the nail, it would
show him to be a Scanner.  He would be respected, but
he would be identified.  He might be stopped by the
guards whom the Instrumentality had undoubtedly set
around the person of Adam Stone.  If he broke the Nail—  But
he couldn't!  No Scanner in the history of the
Confraternity had ever willingly broken his nail.  That would
be Resignation, and there was no such thing.  The only
way out, was in the Up-and Out!  Martel put his finger
to his mouth and bit off the nail.  He looked at the
now-queer finger, and sighed to himself.
</p>
<p>
He stepped toward the city gate, slipping his hand into
his jacket and running up his muscular strength to four
times normal.  He started to scan, and then realized that
his instruments were masked.  <i>Might as well take all the
chances at once</i>, he thought.
</p>
<p>
The watcher stopped him with a searching Wire.  The
sphere thumped suddenly against Mattel's chest.
</p>
<p>
"Are you a Man?" said the unseen voice.  (Martel
would have known that as a Scanner in haberman condition,
his own field-charge would have illuminated the
sphere.)
</p>
<p>
"I am a Man."  Martel knew that the timbre of his
voice had been good; he hoped that it would not be taken
for that of a Manshonjagger or a Beast or an Unforgiven
one, who with mimicry sought to enter the cities and ports
of Mankind.
</p>
<p>
"Name, number, rank, purpose, function, time departed."
</p>
<p>
"Martel."  He had to remember his old number, not
Scanner 34.  "Sunward 4234, 182nd Year of Space.
Rank, rising Subchief."  That was no lie, but his
substantive rank.  "Purpose, personal and lawful within the
limits of this city.  No function of the Instrumentality.
Departed Chief Outport 2019 hours."  Everything now
depended on whether he was believed, or would be checked
against Chief Outport.
</p>
<p>
The voice was flat and routine: "Time desired within
the city."
</p>
<p>
Martel used the standard phrase: "Your Honorable
sufferance is requested."
</p>
<p>
He stood in the cool night air, waiting.  Far above him,
through a gap in the mist, he could see the poisonous
glittering in the sky of Scanners.  <i>The stars are my
enemies, he thought: I have mastered the stars but they hate
me.  Ho, that sounds Ancient!  Like a Book.  Too
much cranching</i>.
</p>
<p>
The voice returned: "Sunward 4234 dash 182 rising
Subchief Martel, enter the lawful gates of the city.
Welcome.  Do you desire food, raiment, money, or
companionship?"  The voice had no hospitality in it, just
business.  This was certainly different from entering a city in
a Scanner's role!  Then the petty officers came out, and
threw their beltlights in their fretful faces, and mouthed
their words with preposterous deference, shouting against
the stone deafness of a Scanner's ears.  So that was the
way that a Subchief was treated: matter of fact, but not
bad.  Not bad.
</p>
<p>
Martel replied: "I have that which I need, but beg of
the city a favor.  My friend Adam Stone is here.  I
desired to see him, on urgent and personal lawful affairs."
</p>
<p>
The voice replied: "Did you have an appointment with
Adam Stone?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"The city will find him.  What is his number?"
</p>
<p>
"I have forgotten it."
</p>
<p>
"You have forgotten it?  Is not Adam Stone a Magnate
of the Instrumentality?  Are you truly his friend?"
</p>
<p>
"Truly."  Martel let a little annoyance creep into his
voice.  "Watcher, doubt me and call your Subchief."
</p>
<p>
"No doubt implied.  Why do you not know the number?
This must go into the record," added the voice.
</p>
<p>
"We were friends in childhood.  He has crossed the—"  Martel
started to say "the Up-and-Out" and remembered
that the phrase was current only among Scanners.  "He
has leapt from Earth to Earth, and has just now returned.
I knew him well and I seek him out.  I have word of his
kith.  May the Instrumentality protect us!"
</p>
<p>
"Heard and believed.  Adam Stone will be searched."
</p>
<p>
At a risk, though a slight one, of having the sphere
sound an alarm for <i>non-human</i>, Martel cut in on his
Scanner speaker within his jacket.  He saw the trembling
needle of light await his words and he started to write on
it with his blunt finger.  <i>That won't work</i>, he thought,
and had a moment's panic until he found his comb, which
had a sharp enough tooth to write.  He wrote: "Emergency
none.  Martel Scanner calling Parizianski Scanner."
</p>
<p>
The needle quivered and the reply glowed and faded
out: "Parizianski Scanner on duty and D. C. Calls taken
by Scanner Relay."
</p>
<p>
Martel cut off his speaker.
</p>
<p>
Parizianski was somewhere around.  Could he have
crossed the direct way, right over the city wall, setting
off the alert, and invoking official business when the petty
officers overtook him in mid-air?  Scarcely.  That meant
that a number of other Scanners must have come in with
Parizianski, all of them pretending to be in search of a
few of the tenuous pleasures which could be enjoyed by a
haberman, such as the sight of the newspictures or the
viewing of beautiful women in the Pleasure Gallery.
Parizianski was around, but he could not have moved privately,
because Scanner Central registered him on duty and
recorded his movements city by city.
</p>
<p>
The voice returned.  Puzzlement was expressed in it.
"Adam Stone is found and awakened.  He has asked
pardon of the Honorable, and says he knows no Martel.  Will
you see Adam Stone in the morning?  The city will bid
you welcome."
</p>
<p>
Martel ran out of resources.  It was hard enough mimicking
a man without having to tell lies in the guise of
one.  Martel could only repeat: "Tell him I am Martel.
The husband of Luci."
</p>
<p>
"It will be done."
</p>
<p>
Again the silence, and the hostile stars, and the sense
that Parizianski was somewhere near and getting nearer;
Martel felt his heart beating faster.  He stole a glimpse
at his chestbox and set his heart down a point.  He felt
calmer, even though he had not been able to scan with
care.
</p>
<p>
The voice this time was cheerful, as though an annoyance
had been settled: "Adam Stone consents to see you.
Enter Chief Downport, and welcome."
</p>
<p>
The little sphere dropped noiselessly to the ground and
the wire whispered away into the darkness.  A bright arc
of narrow light rose from the ground in front of Martel
and swept through the city to one of the higher
towers—apparently a hostel, which Martel had never entered.
Martel plucked his aircoat to his chest for ballast, stepped
heel-and-toe on the beam, and felt himself whistle through
the air to an entrance window which sprang up before
him as suddenly as a devouring mouth.
</p>
<p>
A tower guard stood in the doorway.  "You are awaited,
sir.  Do you bear weapons; sir?"
</p>
<p>
"None," said Martel, grateful that he was relying on
his own strength.
</p>
<p>
The guard let him past the check-screen.  Martel noticed
the quick flight of a warning across the screen as his
instruments registered and identified him as a Scanner.
But the guard had not noticed it.
</p>
<p>
The guard stopped at a door.  "Adam Stone is armed.
He is lawfully armed by authority of the Instrumentality
and by the liberty of this city.  All those who enter are
given warning."
</p>
<p>
Martel nodded in understanding at the man and went in.
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone was a short man, stout and benign.  His
grey hair rose stiffly from a low forehead.  His whole
face was red and merry looking.  He looked like a jolly
guide from the Pleasure Gallery, not like a man who had
been at the edge of the Up-and-Out, righting the Great
Pain without haberman protection.
</p>
<p>
He stared at Martel.  His look was puzzled, perhaps
a little annoyed, but not hostile.
</p>
<p>
Martel came to the point.  "You do not know me.  I
lied.  My name is Martel, and I mean you no harm.  But
I lied.  I beg the Honorable gift of your hospitality.
Remain armed.  Direct your weapon against me—"
</p>
<p>
Stone smiled: "I am doing so," and Martel noticed the
small Wirepoint in Stone's capable plump hand.
</p>
<p>
"Good.  Keep on guard against me.  It will give you
confidence in what I shall say.  But do, I beg you, give
us a screen of privacy.  I want no casual lookers.  This
is a matter of life and death."
</p>
<p>
"First: whose life and death?"  Stone's face remained
calm, his voice even.
</p>
<p>
"Yours, and mine, and the worlds'."
</p>
<p>
"You are cryptic but I agree."  Stone called through
the doorway: "Privacy please."  There was a sudden hum,
and all the little noises of the night quickly vanished from
the air of the room.
</p>
<p>
Said Adam Stone: "Sir, who are you?  What brings
you here?"
</p>
<p>
"I am Scanner Thirty-four."
</p>
<p>
"You a Scanner.  I don't believe it."
</p>
<p>
For answer, Martel pulled his jacket open, showing his
chestbox.  Stone looked up at him, amazed.  Martel
explained:
</p>
<p>
"I am cranched.  Have you never seen it before?"
</p>
<p>
"Not with men.  On animals.  Amazing!  But—what
do you want?"
</p>
<p>
"The truth.  Do you fear me?"
</p>
<p>
"Not with this," said Stone, grasping the Wirepoint.
"But I shall tell you the truth."
</p>
<p>
"Is it true that you have conquered the Great Pain?"
</p>
<p>
Stone hesitated, seeking words for an answer.
</p>
<p>
"Quick, can you tell me how you have done it, so that
I may believe you?"
</p>
<p>
"I have loaded the ships with life."
</p>
<p>
"Life?"
</p>
<p>
"Life.  I don't know what the great pain is, but I did
find that in the experiments, when I sent out masses of
animals or plants, the life in the center of the mass lived
longest.  I built ships—small ones, of course—and sent
them out with rabbits, with monkeys—"
</p>
<p>
"Those are Beasts?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes.  With small Beasts.  And the Beasts came back
unhurt.  They came back because the walls of the ships
were filled with life.  I tried many kinds, and finally found
a sort of life which lives in the waters.  Oysters.
Oyster-beds.  The outermost oyster died in the Great Pain.  The
inner ones lived.  The passengers were unhurt."
</p>
<p>
"But they were Beasts?"
</p>
<p>
"Not only Beasts.  Myself."
</p>
<p>
"You!"
</p>
<p>
"I came through Space alone.  Through what you call
the Up-and-Out, alone.  Awake and sleeping.  I am
unhurt.  If you do not believe me, ask your brother
Scanners.  Come and see my ship in the morning.  I will be
glad to see you then, along with your brother Scanners.
I am going to demonstrate before the Chiefs of the
Instrumentality."
</p>
<p>
Martel repeated his question: "You came here alone?"
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone grew testy: "Yes, alone.  Go back and
check your Scanner's register if you do not believe me.
You never put me in a bottle to cross space."
</p>
<p>
Martel's face was radiant.  "I believe you now.  It is
true.  No more Scanners.  No more habermans.  No
more cranching."
</p>
<p>
Stone looked significantly toward the door.
</p>
<p>
Martel did not take the hint.  "I must tell you that—"
</p>
<p>
"Sir, tell me in the morning.  Go enjoy your cranch.
Isn't it supposed to be pleasure?  Medically I know it
well.  But not in practice."
</p>
<p>
"It is pleasure.  It's normality—for a while.  But
listen.  The Scanners have sworn to destroy you, and your
work."
</p>
<p>
"What!"
</p>
<p>
"They have met and have voted and sworn.  You will
make Scanners unnecessary, they say.  You will bring
the Ancient Wars back to the world, if Scanning is lost
and the Scanners live in vain!"
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone was nervous but kept his wits about him:
"You're a Scanner.  Are you going to kill me—or try?"
</p>
<p>
"No, you fool.  I have betrayed the Confraternity.  Call
guards the moment I escape.  Keep guards around you.
I will try to intercept the killer."
</p>
<p>
Martel saw a blur in the window.  Before Stone could
turn, the Wirepoint was whipped out of his hand.  The
blur solidified and took form as Parizianski.
</p>
<p>
Martel recognized what Parizianski was doing: <i>High
speed</i>.
</p>
<p>
Without thinking of his cranch, he thrust his hand to
his chest, set himself up to <i>High speed</i> too.  Waves of
fire, like the Great Pain, but hotter, flooded over him.  He
fought to keep his face readable as he stepped in front of
Parizianski and gave the sign,
</p>
<p>
<i>Top Emergency</i>.
</p>
<p>
Parizianski spoke, while the normally-moving body of
Stone stepped away from them as slowly as a drifting
cloud: "Get out of my way.  I am on a mission."
</p>
<p>
"I know it.  I stop you here and now.  Stop.  Stop.
Stop.  Stone is right."
</p>
<p>
Parizianski's lips were barely readable in the haze of
pain which flooded Martel.  (He thought: <i>God, God.  God
of the Ancients!  Let me hold on!  Let me live under
Overload just long enough!</i>)  Parizianski was saying:
"Get out of my way.  By order of the Confraternity, get
out of my way!"  And Parizianski gave the sign, <i>Help
I demand in the name of my duty!</i>
</p>
<p>
Martel choked for breath in the syrup-like air.  He
tried one last time: "Parizianski, friend, friend, my friend.
Stop.  Stop."  (No Scanner had ever murdered Scanner
before.)
</p>
<p>
Parizianski made the sign: <i>You are unfit for duty, and
I will take over</i>.
</p>
<p>
Martel thought, "For first time in the world!" as he
reached over and twisted Parizianski's Brainbox up to
Overload.  Parizianski's eyes glittered in terror and
understanding.  His body began to drift down toward the
floor.
</p>
<p>
Martel had just strength enough to reach his own
<i>Chestbox</i>.  As he faded into haberman or death, he knew
not which, he felt his fingers turning on the control of
speed, turning down.  He tried to speak, to say, "Get a
Scanner, I need help, get a Scanner...."
</p>
<p>
But the darkness rose about him, and the numb silence
clasped him.
</p>
<p>
Martel awakened to see the face of Luci near his own.
</p>
<p>
He opened his eyes wider, and found that he was
hearing—hearing the sound of her happy weeping, the sound
of her chest as she caught the air back into her throat.
</p>
<p>
He spoke weakly: "Still cranched?  Alive?"
</p>
<p>
Another face swam into the blur beside Luci's.  It was
Adam Stone.  His deep voice rang across immensities
of space before coming to Mattel's hearing.  Mattel tried
to read Stone's lips, but could not make them out.  He
went back to listening to the voice:
</p>
<p>
"...not cranched.  Do you understand me?  Not
cranched!"
</p>
<p>
Mattel tried to say: "But I can hear!  I can feel!"  The
others got his sense if not his words.
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone spoke again:
</p>
<p>
"You have gone back through the Haberman.  I put
you back first.  I didn't know how it would work in practice,
but I had the theory all worked out.  You don't think
the Instrumentality would waste the Scanners, do
you?  You go back to normality.  We are letting the
habermans die as fast as the ships come in.  They don't
need to live any more.  But we are restoring the Scanners.
You are the first.  Do you understand?  You are the
first.  Take it easy, now."
</p>
<p>
Adam Stone smiled.  Dimly behind Stone, Mattel
thought that he saw the face of one of the Chiefs of the
Instrumentality.  That face, too, smiled at him, and then
both faces disappeared upward and away.
</p>
<p>
Martel tried to lift his head, to scan himself.  He could
not.  Luci stared at him, calming herself, but with an
expression of loving perplexity.  She said,
</p>
<p>
"My darling husband!  You're back again, to stay!"
</p>
<p>
Still, Martel tried to see his box.  Finally he swept his
hand across his chest with a clumsy motion.  There was
nothing there.  The instruments were gone.  He was
back to normality but still alive.
</p>
<p>
In the deep weak peacefulness of his mind, another
troubling thought took shape.  He tried to write with his
finger, the way that Luci wanted him to, but he had
neither pointed fingernail nor Scanner's Tablet.  He had
to use his voice.  He summoned up his strength and
whispered:
</p>
<p>
"Scanners?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, darling?  What is it?"
</p>
<p>
"Scanners?"
</p>
<p>
"Scanners.  Oh, yes, darling, they're all right.  They
had to arrest some of them for going into <i>High Speed</i>
and running away.  But the Instrumentality caught them
all—all those on the ground—and they're happy now.  Do
you know, darling," she laughed, "some of them didn't
want to be restored to normality.  But Stone and his
Chiefs persuaded them."
</p>
<p>
"Vomact?"
</p>
<p>
"He's fine, too.  He's staying cranched until he can be
restored.  Do you know, he has arranged for Scanners
to take new jobs.  You're all to be Deputy Chiefs for
Space.  Isn't that nice?  But he got himself made Chief
for Space.  You're all going to be pilots, so that your
fraternity and guild can go on.  And Chang's getting
changed right now.  You'll see him soon."
</p>
<p>
Her face turned sad.  She looked at him earnestly and
said: "I might as well tell you now.  You'll worry
otherwise.  There has been one accident.  Only one.  When
you and your friend called on Adam Stone, your friend
was so happy that he forgot to scan, and he let himself
die of <i>Overload</i>."
</p>
<p>
"Called on Stone?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes.  Don't you remember?  Your friend."
</p>
<p>
He still looked surprised, so she said:
</p>
<p>
"Parizianski."

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
